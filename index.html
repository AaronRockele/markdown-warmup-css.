    <h2>pro's</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>build in live browser view is great! if you work on css it even highlight the the tag your working on.</li>
        <li>it's a free open source program that's also <i>cross platform</i>.</li>
        <li>Brackets is being actively maintained and developed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>cons</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>the live browser view only works with <b>chrome.</b></li>
        <li>since brackets is an open source software, it is always inproving. so if you feel like there is lacking something after a while it will probably be added in a software update.</li>
        <li>it would be nice if brackets had a sharing function. so you could easy share your code between users so they could help you work on you projects. but hey there you got github for! &#129320;</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>why do i use it?</h2>

    <p>that's very easy. i use it because i know it. i learned this in school and just kept using it and it has never failed me. well didn't do much more then HTML and CSS so i might find some difficulties when i have to use it for heavier things. </p>

    <code> <q>Brackets is a very attractive and visually attractive code editor for the development of code, especially very useful for the development of web applications due to its support for php, css and javascript for those who implement the auto-completion function in a very accurate way and intuitive. - happy user </q></code>

    </div>

    <h2>pro's</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Formatting and defining rules for each language is a very useful feature in this IDE.</li>
        <li>Great code completion, just start typing some code and the program will fill in the code.</li>
        <li>The code can be deployed very easy from Netbeans itself.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>cons</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Sometimes the code hints are a little intrusive and need to be 'turned off'</li>
        <li> If you have too many projects open, Netbeans takes quite a while to load. </li>
        <li>
            Code completion and PHP platform function helps can occasionally be more of a curse than a blessing. Constant 'pop ups' of hints, suggestions make coding a bit aggravating.
            <ul>
                <li>pop ups</li>
                <li>hints</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
